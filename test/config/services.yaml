# Service specific configurations

# ==============================================================================================================================================
# WARNING!!!
#   The google_books and amazon services defined below are required by several of the tests:
#
#     - test_broker  <- Defines mock implementations for both of these services
#     - 
#
# It is recommended that you add additional services if you want to test additional functionality rather than modifying these services!
